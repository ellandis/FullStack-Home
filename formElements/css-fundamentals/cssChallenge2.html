          Full stack developers need a variety of skills, including: Programming
          languages Full stack developers need to be proficient in multiple
          programming languages, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for
          front-end development, and Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, or .NET for
          back-end development. Version control Full stack developers need to be
          able to use a version control system like Git to keep track of code
          changes, revert to previous versions, and manage multiple versions of
          their code. Communication Full stack developers need to be able to
          communicate clearly with colleagues, clients, and managers. Web
          architecture Full stack developers need to understand web
          architecture, which involves planning and creating the appearance of a
          website. CSS CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a key part of full
          stack development, as it provides the visual design of a website or
          app.
