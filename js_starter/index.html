    <h1 id="title">Nothing is Free</h1>
    <p id="freelunch">
      There's no such thing as free because everything comes at a cost, whether
      visible or hidden. When something appears free, the price is often paid in
      other forms, such as time, data, effort, or opportunity. Companies might
      offer a "free" service but make money through ads, data collection, or
      future purchases. Even in nature, animals and plants must invest energy
      and resources to survive and thrive. Hence, the concept of 'free' is more
      of an illusion, as there's always an underlying exchange happening.
      Straight to the heart of it. What do you think?
